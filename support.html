			<h1>Experience</h1>

				<p>
					I've had 20 years in IT support right through from the coal face to the behind the scenes (second &amp; third level) support. I've a wealth of experience with a range of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X (now referred to as Apple OS). I have extensive experience supporting Microsoft Office, Windows 7, Windows 10, Redhat Linux and SuSE Linux and Apple software. Additionally I've supported a range of Desktop and Laptop hardware ranging across Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Apple Vendors. I've also supported and installed POS. I've supported home users, small businesses and also provided several tiers of support at an enterprise level.
